    "description": "The FROK project is building towards a future where intelligence (test-time compute) is priced and distributed similarly to blockspace and gas markets. The ultimate form-factor Frok seeks to enable is pay-per-use, raw intelligence. From just-in-time created features to code runtime environments and more, Frok aims to cater to the needs of power users, with a distinct focus on speed and ergonomics.",
